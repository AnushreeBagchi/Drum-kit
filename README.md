## This is a part of the 30 day [Javascript Challenge](https://javascript30.com/) 


This is Drum-Kit made with Javascript.

Take this for a spin at [https://anushreebagchi.github.io/Drum-kit/](https://anushreebagchi.github.io/Drum-kit/)

### Features 
- When a key is pressed the corresponding sound will be played.
- Also clicking on a key will play the sound.

Here is a sample gif. Of course this also has sound that I couldn't capture in the gif!
